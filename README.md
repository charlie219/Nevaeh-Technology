## [Client Server Interaction using Socket in C++](https://github.com/charlie219/Nevaeh-Technology/tree/main/Client-Server-Communication)
        
   This is a Socket program which enables on way communication (Client -> Server) and store the communication in a LOG.txt. The Server is secured with a username and password which enables the server security. The Server connection disconnects iff either the Client send "quit" to the Server or the comunication delay is more than 10 sec. The interaction is stacked in a text file named LOG.txt which is created during the execution of the program.
